# dailyinfocrawler

Repo contains scripts to automatically crawl Daily Info's listing of rooms and flats to let in Oxford.

The crawler automatically pulls their listing and compares to the last listing it saw.
If there is a difference, it is formated (a bit :)) and sent to me via email.

TODO: adapt a similar script to crawl homes-to-let
TODO: make emails better formatted
